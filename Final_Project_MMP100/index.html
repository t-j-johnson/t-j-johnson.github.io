    <h1>
        Interesting Objects
    </h1>
        <p>
            In this mini series I asked individuals to describe an object that they have in their possession that they find some sort of sentimental or overall entertaining value out of. It was my anthropological background that led me to this kind of project, as I always found what we own to be an indicator of who we are, at least to some degree. Even more prominent is this indication if we deliberately choose to hold onto something for a long time, or to collect items of a similar nature.
        </p>
        <p>
            Below you will find videos of the recorded interviews, as well as interpretive speed drawings of each object. I hope that you will find enjoyment and insight from hearing these stories, and may be able to reflect on interesting objects in your life. What do they mean to you?
        </p>
