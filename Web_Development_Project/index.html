        You MUST survive...
    </h1>
   
    <p>
        It's been 3 months since the Zorkana came to Earth and made first contact. At first we thought that they, with their greenish-yellow skin, and multiple tentacles came in peace. We couldn't have been more wrong. World leaders were assassinated, food and water supply lines cut off, and the last remnants of humanity are living under an iron-tentacle. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Now it's all up to you special agent [REDACTED], you must infiltrate the Zorkana's space elevator, bring a sysmic electro-bomb up to the mothership, and blow the whole thing to pieces. Luckily, you've just arrived outside the gates of the elevator complex, bomb in tow. Now all you have to do is complete the mission and save humanity. Oh, and of course, DON'T GET ZORKED!!!
