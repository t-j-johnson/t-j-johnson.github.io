        You're a genius...?
    </h1>
   
    <p>
        You walk on over to the terminal, completedly perplexed by the flashing Zorklesh buttons and terminal commands. If you only you studied more in school. Somehow you get reminded about a bender you went on once, where you stumbled home and saw a bad episode of the show <i>Ancient Aliens</i>. In-between burps and butt scratches you vaguely remember a hieroglyphic thing that including some symbols that seem to match some of what you now see on the terminal. The host mentioned (you think) words like "prosperity", "strength", and "yes" during this clip.
    </p>

    <p>
        With your newfound <i>Knowledge</i> you look for the nearest synbol that matches your stupored haze of a memory, finding a button that matches at least one of them. You slam it, and suddenly the mag-trams and hover-carts go faster than you can keep track of. Their contents spilling over their container fields, and falling to the floor of the complex. Suddenly, some of the cargo begins to explode, an alarm begins blaring, and the Zorkana are panicked, running about try to dodge random blastsâ€”prisoners as well. In the commotion you act accordingly and begin flailing your arms and screaming at the top of your lungs while you make a hectic line for the elvevator. As the doors close on you, the sounds of the chaos you unfolded fade to silence, replaced by smooth Jazz. Maybe the Zorkana use this for themselves, or to placate prisoners, either way you appreciate the break.

    <h2>The Elevator</h2>
    
    <p>
       The elevator is far slower than you imagined it would be. Even though it is going up at the rate of a typical skyscraper elevator you still find yourself slowly leaving Earth and passing the atmosphere. You see as Zorkana fighter ships take-off from the still exploding complex. At the same time fighters are coming down from above through the atmosphere. You're sandwhiched between the two, and as the various fighters lock on to the elevator with their cannons, you start to wonder if there is any way out of this.
