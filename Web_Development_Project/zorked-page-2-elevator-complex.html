        You made it inside...
    </h1>
   
    <p>
        You don a makeshift coconut bra and grass skirt as well as "art-student" black tights, produce a ukelele from your backpack and jump out from behind your hiding place. You begin to play and to dance, which surprisingly seems to have mystified the Zorkana guards (command is making note of this just in case you die). As your hips sway, so to do their bodies; tentacles writhing in a motion to the music.
    </p>

    <p>
        However, suddenly a string breaks as you try to do a power chord. The trance state has been broken, and the Zorkana start moving towards you. You unclip your coconuts and throw one at each guard with the force of existentiaism that can only be exhibited by a background of unfulfilled dreams, incapacitating them. Their eyes close and you swipe a key-card off of one of the guards, opening the gate. You quickly move inside and take a position near the complex's neo-garbage compactor.

    <h2>The Elevator Complex</h2>
    
    <p>
        The smell is overwhelming, what do these stringy bastards even eat? You try to maintain focus, and look around the complex, a massive shimmering metallic base with technolgies far beyond human capabilities, supplies of unknown origin are being zipped around by mag-trams and hover-carts. There are Zorkana absolutely everywhere. You spot the space elevator's door about 800 yards from you.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        You notice off to the western side of the complex there seems to be a regular stream of Zorkana escorting human captives to the elevator from a holding cell-block. Probably taking them to get Zorked in the mothership. You also notice that there is a terminal not too far from you that a few Zorkana have come up to and pressed various buttons, buteven from here you can tell that the whole thing is in Zorklesh, the native tongue of these creeps. You contemplate how to proceed.
