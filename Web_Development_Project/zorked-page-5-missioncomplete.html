        Realizing that this is the end of the line, and noticing that somehow the Zorkana were in such a rush they forgot to strip you of all possessions, sans laser-pointer, you reach into your tactical pocket, the velcro sending a reverberating riiiiiiiiippp through the throne room. Time slows, and the Zorkan begin to try and stop you. As tears run down your face as you think of everyone back home that you will no longer see you let out your final words: "Zork This...".
    </p>

    <p>
        You press the button and are torn to shreds, along with everything else in the throne room. The electro-blast echoes throughout the armada and ripples through Earth, shutting down the systems of all Zorkana tech, and all electrical human technology, exploding the former. Command really packed it in this time.

        As time passes, the remaining Zorkana are wiped out by the remaining humans with the remaining non-electrical weaponry they have left; a mixture of pillaged museum artifacts, decommisioned tanks, and all the rifles a Wal-Mart can hold assisting them. A new day has dawned, but humans have been pushed back technologically by quite few hundred years, save for a few mix-ins. Without Wikipedia it may take Humanity a while yet to get to where we once were. Hopefully the other side of your sacrifice will have been for the better, and the world can work together towards a better future than what existed before.
